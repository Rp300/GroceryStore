# A simple test to check functionality of a single register and only one type of customer
test1: t=7 minutes

# Medium test, testing multiple registers(training vs non training rates) as well as alternating customer types
test2: t=13 minutes

# Tests that departing customers(custs with 0 items) when a new customer is processed to be added to a register
test3: t=6 minutes

# Test to illustrate that constraint of customer 'A' works effectively
test4: t=9 minutes

# Tests that in common arrival times customers of type 'A' select a register before 'B'
test5: t=11

# Tests that the customer 'A' constraint applies effectively to a larger amount of registers, with a single 'B' near the end to ensure the shortest line is picked.
test6: t=24

# Simple test to ensure that customer of type 'A' goes to first line when both lines have equal length
test7: t=14 minutes

# Simple test to ensure that customer of type 'B' goes to first line when all last customers have equal number of items
test8: t=14 minutes

# Hard test: tests that a single register orders a given customer arrival time packet as well as multiple type of customers
test9: t=55 minutes
